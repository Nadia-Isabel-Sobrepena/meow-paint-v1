# Meow Paint - v1

https://meow-paint-v1.netlify.app/

A cozy, cat-themed recreation of the classic Windows 98 Paint interface.

This project was created through a process of "vibe coding"—collaborating with Google AI Studio to explore the technical layout of 90s software while injecting my own personal artistic style.

----

As an artist who loves to draw, I wanted to understand how the software of my childhood actually worked. I used AI as a "pair programmer" to help me learn the structure of Windows 98 using modern web tools.

While the layout is a tribute to 1998, the aesthetic is entirely my own. I transformed the grey, corporate look of the original into a pastel, cat-inspired playground where I can make artwork in a space that feels like home.

## Features

Nostalgic UI: Classic beveled borders and a Windows 98 structure, but with a "Neko" twist.
Cat Ears Window: A custom window container featuring decorative cat ears.
Drawing Tools: Includes the Pencil, Tail Brush, Paw Eraser, and Yarn Line tools.
Kitten Stamp: A special tool to instantly add kittens to your canvas.
Custom Palette: A hand-picked selection of 28 pastel colors that fit a cozy aesthetic.
System Cursors: Reverted to classic Windows-style cursors for that authentic "retro" drawing feel.

## How I Built It

I approached this project by focusing on three main areas:

The Layout (HTML): Mapping out the classic sidebar toolbar, the workspace, and the bottom-docked color palette.
The Style (CSS): Learning how to create 3D "beveled" edges using specific border colors, and then softening them with rounded corners and pastels to match my vibe.
The Engine (JavaScript): Building a functional drawing engine using the HTML5 Canvas API to handle freehand drawing, shapes, and color picking.


## My Aesthetic Vision
I believe that the tools we use to create art should be as inspiring as the art itself. By merging the functional "bones" of Windows 98 with a cute, kitten-themed interface, I’ve created a digital sketchbook that makes the process of "making" feel more playful and cozy.

Purr-fectly crafted for the retro-loving artist.
